# Tic Tac Toe

In this project, i built a Tic-tac-toe that can be executed on the console, and it would be played by 0, 1 or 2 persons

The main goal is to put into practice main concepts from Object Oriented Programming (OOT) but mostly classes and their attributes.

###### Definition

> 'Tic-tac-toe (American English), noughts and crosses (Commonwealth English), or Xs and Os (Irish English) is a paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. It is a solved game, with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.

###### Behavior

- The game starts displaying the Title and ask for how many players
- Asks for first and second player names if there are more than 1
- The game prompts the first player to select from available moves
- Once a player has selected a valid move, the game is updated and shows the board
- We switch the turn to the second player and repeat behavior
- The game ends when there is a winner or it is a draw
